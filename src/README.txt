Project based on Brunel paper to modelise the activity of neurons with different parameters

*There is two classes : 
Neuron and Simulation.
Neurons are by default excitatory neurons which means that when they spike, they give a positive current
to all of their neighbours. Inhibitory neurons give a negative current to their neighbours when they spike.
Simulation corresponds to the network of Neuron.

*Tests are done in Neur_unittest.cpp

*Display of graphs is done in main.cpp

*Directories : 
./src		./docs		./build
./src contains all the documents I coded and the gtest downloaded from github (need to download it)
./docs contains the document generated by Doxygen


*To do the tests or show the graphs, be in directory called : build 
And write the following lines in the terminal :
	cmake ../src
	make
	./Neur_unittest		or			./Neuron
	
*To generate the documentation, be in directory called : build
And write the following line in the terminal :
	makedoc
